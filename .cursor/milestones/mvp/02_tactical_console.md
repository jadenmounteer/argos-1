# Tactical Console (The Interface)

## Goal

Build the React LCARS-inspired UI and integrate the Web Speech API for "Wake Word" and command transcription.

### Tasks

Note on Browser Compatibility: The Web Speech API is most stable in Chrome/Edge. For the MVP, ensure the UI has a "Manual Override" (a text input box) in case the microphone environment is noisy or the browser limits the API.

Note on State: Keep the speech-to-text state separate from the AI-response state to prevent the "feedback loop" where ARGOS reviews its own spoken words.

#### [ ] Task 1: Frontend Scaffolding (The Bridge)

Initialize a React + Vite project using TypeScript.

Set up a specialized CSS module or Tailwind config for the "Linear Dashboard" (Inspired-by-LCARS) aesthetic—prioritize high-contrast oranges, purples, and blues.

Create a responsive "Frame" layout with a sidebar for "Ship Status" and a main viewport for "Tactical Logs."

#### [ ] Task 2: Web Speech Integration (The Ears)

Implement a useArgosVoice hook utilizing the window.SpeechRecognition (or webkitSpeechRecognition) API.

Add logic for Wake Word Detection (listening specifically for "Argos" or "Computer").

Create a visual "Listening" indicator that pulses when the microphone is active.

#### [ ] Task 3: Real-Time Stream Consumer (The Data Link)

Implement a service to consume the Spring Boot /api/v1/command endpoint.

Pro Tip: Use Server-Sent Events (SSE) or a simple Fetch stream reader to display text as it is generated by the local LLM.

Acceptance: The UI must not "freeze" while waiting for the full response.

#### [ ] Task 4: Reasoning & Response UI (The Display)

Build a specialized "Tactical Log" component that differentiates between:

Thought: (The <thought> tags from DeepSeek) - Styled as "Internal Diagnostics."

Response: The final output to the user - Styled as "Main Display."

Implement an "Auto-scroll" feature so the logs feel like a live readout.

#### [ ] Task 5: Intent Execution Feedback

Add status "badges" to show the current state of ARGOS-1: IDLE, LISTENING, ANALYZING, BREACH DETECTED.
