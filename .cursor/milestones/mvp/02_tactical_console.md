# Tactical Console (The Interface)

## Goal

Build the React LCARS-inspired UI and integrate the Web Speech API for "Wake Word" and command transcription.

### Tasks

Note on Browser Compatibility: The Web Speech API is most stable in Chrome/Edge. For the MVP, ensure the UI has a "Manual Override" (a text input box) in case the microphone environment is noisy or the browser limits the API.

Note on State: Keep the speech-to-text state separate from the AI-response state to prevent the "feedback loop" where ARGOS reviews its own spoken words.

#### [ ] Task 1: Frontend Scaffolding (The Bridge)

Initialize a React + Vite project using TypeScript.

Set up a specialized CSS module or Tailwind config for the "Linear Dashboard" (Inspired-by-LCARS) aesthetic—prioritize high-contrast oranges, purples, and blues.

Create a responsive "Frame" layout with a sidebar for "Ship Status" and a main viewport for "Tactical Logs."

#### [ ] Task 2: Web Speech Integration (The Ears)

Build a Standalone Vocal Provider: Create a React Context or Redux slice that acts as a 'Vocal Service.' It should be able to run independently of the Tactical UI, emitting standardized text events to the Kernel.

Create a visual "Listening" indicator that pulses when the microphone is active.

Build the speech recognition as a standalone React Hook/Provider that follows the Adapter pattern, keeping it decoupled from the Main Terminal component.

#### [ ] Task 3: Real-Time Stream Consumer (The Data Link)

Implement a service to consume the Spring Boot /api/v1/command endpoint.

Pro Tip: Use Server-Sent Events (SSE) or a simple Fetch stream reader to display text as it is generated by the local LLM.

Acceptance: The UI must not "freeze" while waiting for the full response.

#### [ ] Task 4: Reasoning & Response UI (The Display)

Build a specialized "Tactical Log" component that differentiates between:

Thought: (The <thought> tags from DeepSeek) - Styled as "Internal Diagnostics."

Response: The final output to the user - Styled as "Main Display."

Implement an "Auto-scroll" feature so the logs feel like a live readout.

#### [ ] Task 5: Intent Execution Feedback

Add status "badges" to show the current state of ARGOS-1: IDLE, LISTENING, ANALYZING, BREACH DETECTED.

[ ] Task 6: Containerized Orchestration (Docker Compose)
Create a docker-compose.yml that links the Spring Boot Hub, the React Console, and Ollama.

Use a Named Volume for Ollama (e.g., ollama_data:/root/.ollama) so models aren't re-downloaded when the container restarts.

Keep Ollama in its own container to demonstrate that the "Brain" is an interchangeable service.
keep your application.properties set to localhost (the "Developer Default") and use the Uppercase Underscore convention in your docker-compose.yml.
